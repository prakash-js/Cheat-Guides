In Windows, there are two ways to use commands: cmd.exe and powershell.exe.


**CMD** is a traditional, text-based command-line interpreter based on MS-DOS. It has been a part of Windows operating systems for decades and offers limited updates.

**PowerShell** is a more powerful and flexible object-oriented shell and scripting language built on the .NET framework. It is actively developed and receives regular updates.
